3. **Install [ffmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)** and add it to your PATH (required for audio conversion).
4. **Create a Spotify app:**
   - Go to [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)
   - Create an app and copy your `client_id` and `client_secret`.
   - Create a file at `MusicDL/config/spotify_credentials.json` (not included for security) with:
     ```json
     {
       "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
       "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
     }
     ```

## Troubleshooting
- **Missing ffmpeg:** Make sure `ffmpeg` is installed and in your PATH.
